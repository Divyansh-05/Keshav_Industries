<p><strong>Returns, Refunds, and Exchange</strong> is the scheme provided by Keshav Industries in relation to specific products. Returns, refund, and exchange policy gives you an option to return or exchange items purchased on our platform, within the specified return/exchange period, as detailed on the product details page, subject to applicable terms and conditions set out under this Policy and/or such other policies as may be applicable from time to time.</p>

<h3>Returns</h3>

<p>At the time of purchasing any products that are listed on the Platform, You will be visiting the product description page which will set out whether the product is returnable or not. The products that are explicitly identified as ‘not returnable’ on the product detail page cannot be returned while the products which are identified as ‘returnable’ are eligible for return with the conditions as specified in the product description page and this policy. The Platform at its discretion may not accept returns of any Product for reasons, including but not limited to, the products being sold under any offer, promotion or discount, if the product being returned is not in good condition, etc.</p>

<p>Keshav Industries shall not be liable or accountable for accepting returns in the circumstances where You have: (a) not followed the process of initiating returns as provided in this Policy and in other communications to You, (b) returned a shipment with wrong product, extra product or missing products, and (c) acted in a bad faith or fraudulent manner. Further, in the event of abuse of the Platform or the Platform policies which include excessive returns, high claim percentage or refusal to accept shipments, indication of any fraudulent or suspicious activity or behavior on our Platform or association with any such activity or behavior, including where your user metrics such as your claim rate, return rate etc., are higher than the average rate of the other users on our platform (“Abuse of Platform Policies”); Keshav Industries shall at its sole discretion not accept any return initiated by You or compensate you for wrong/damaged/missing products.</p>

<p>With respect to products that are identified as ‘non-returnable’ on the product display page, you will be allowed to exchange such products subject to applicable policies of the platform. In the event that a product for which only exchange is available as per the product description page, the user can opt for a ‘call me back’ option and the returns will be enabled for that user if it is found that the return has been initiated for genuine reasons, at the sole discretion of Keshav Industries.</p>

<h3>Return Options</h3>

<p>Certain products on Keshav Industries will have two return options available: (a) wrong/defective items return option, and (b) all return option. If a product does not have the aforementioned options for return, the return option available for the Product in the product description page will be applicable. All return options are subject to the product being identified as returnable in the product description page.</p>

<h4>What is the ‘Only wrong/defect item return option’ and ‘all issue easy return’ options?</h4>

<p>Subject to applicable policies, Keshav Industries provides an ‘all return option’ to its users, wherein users will be able to enjoy certain privileges on a specific product in lieu of payment of a premium on the product cost. Features of an all return option are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The user will be allowed to return an already purchased product, if the said product is eligible for returns.</li>
    <li>The user will be eligible to return the specific product for reasons other than the product being wrong or damaged.</li>
    <li>The all return option is available only for specific products and may not be available for all products which are listed on the Platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>If You are not availing an all return option, you may avail the ‘Wrong/Defect item return option’. If you opt for the Wrong/Defect item return option, then subject to applicable policies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The user will be allowed to return an already purchased product, if the said product is eligible for return/exchange.</li>
    <li>The user will only be eligible to return the product if the product received is defective, damaged, wrong or incomplete due to the seller's fault.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cost of Return</h3>

<p>If you have opted for an all return option and are eligible to return the product as per applicable policies, you may return the product free of cost no matter what the reason.</p>

<p>If you have opted for the Wrong/Defect return option and are eligible to return the product as per applicable policies, you may return the product free of cost if fault with the product lies with the supplier. The following are the faults that lie with the supplier:</p>

<Table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Return Reason Category</th>

In the event that Keshav Industries or the seller is not able to meet the exchange requested by You due to non availability of the product, the exchange request will be converted to a return request by Keshav Industries, at the sole discretion of Keshav Industries and such a return will be subject to the terms and conditions of this policy.</p>
